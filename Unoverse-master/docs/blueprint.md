## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Vibrant blue (#29ABE2) to represent a lively and engaging atmosphere, evoking the spirit of fun competition. 
- Background color: Light grayish blue (#D8E9EF), creating a clean, unobtrusive backdrop that keeps the focus on the game itself.
- Accent color: Analogous green (#90EE90), which complements the primary blue and introduces a subtle, natural contrast without being too distracting. It enhances key UI elements like call-to-action buttons or highlighted text.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a sans-serif font providing a neutral, objective, and easily readable text.
- Use clear, intuitive icons to represent game actions (e.g., drawing cards, skipping turns). Ensure the style matches Uno's established visual language.
- Clean, modern layout with an intuitive card placement scheme. Focus on the interactive card areas.
- Subtle transitions and animations when cards are played, drawn, or the turn changes. Avoid excessive or distracting animations.
